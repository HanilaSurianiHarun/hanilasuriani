		<h5>UiTM's Proud Student - An Ambitious Girl</h5><br>
		<p>Assalamualaikum and Hi! My fullname is Hanila Suriani binti Harun but you may call me Hani for short. I'm from D1IM1105A. I'm 21 years old, living at Setiu, Terengganu. I am a student majoring in Information Management. I was born on August 16, 2001 at Pusat Rawatan MUIP, Kuantan, Pahang.</p><br>
		<p>Let me guess, you must be wondering, why do I live in Terengganu and not Pahang? This is because, in 2014, there was a major flood in Kuantan, Pahang, that claimed many lives. My parents made a business known as Keropok Cap Bunga Emas, selling varieties of keropok. My parents' business consisted of foods that used fish as the main ingredient, including, keropok keping, keropok lekor, sos pencicah, keropok frozen, keropok segera and many more. All of the ingredients used are made entirely from my mother's recipe. Therefore, in order to not bear that risk anymore, both my parents decided to relocate and get active in their business in Terengganu.	So, there you go, a bit story of my parent's occupation.
